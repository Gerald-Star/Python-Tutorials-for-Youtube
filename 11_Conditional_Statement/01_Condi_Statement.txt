# what is conditional statement?

# A conditional statement is a set of rules performed if a certain condition is met.
# Python supports the following conditional statements:


# Python supports using condition statements in the following ways:

# if statement: It is used to execute a block of code only if a condition is true.

# if statement: An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.


# if...else statement: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

# if...else statement: An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.


# if...elif...else statement: It is used to execute one block of code from multiple blocks of code depending on the condition.

# if...elif...else statement: An if statement can be followed by an optional elif statement and then by an optional else statement.


# The if statement is written using the if keyword followed by a boolean expression. If the boolean expression evaluates to True, the code block inside the if statement is executed. Otherwise, the code block is skipped.

# The else statement is written using the else keyword. The else statement is executed when the boolean expression in the if statement evaluates to False.

# The else statement is optional and is used to execute a block of code if none of the conditions are True.


# The elif statement is written using the elif keyword. The elif statement is used to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions is True.


# Nested if statement: It is used to execute a block of code based on another block of code.

# Short Hand If: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

# Short Hand If...else: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.


# And: It is a logical operator that is used to combine conditional statements.

# Or: It is a logical operator that is used to combine conditional statements.

# Not: It is a logical operator that is used to reverse the logical state of a conditional statement.


# Python allows the use of logical operators to combine conditional statements. 
# The logical operators are and, or, and not.

# Equals to (==): The double equals sign (==) is used to compare two values.

# Not equal to (!=): The exclamation mark followed by an equal sign (!=) is used to compare two values.

# Greater than (>): The greater than operator (>) is used to check if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

# Less than (<): The less than operator (<) is used to check if the left operand is less than the right operand.

# Greater than or equal to (>=): The greater than or equal to operator (>=) is used to check if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

# Less than or equal to (<=): The less than or equal to operator (<=) is used to check if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

# Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. There are two identity operators in Python:

# is: Returns True if both operands are the same object.

# is not: Returns True if both operands are not the same object.
