#? There are four collection data types in Python:

# List: A collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple: A collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set: A collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary: A collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

# USE CASES FOR COLLECTIONS
# Use a list when you have a collection of items that are ordered and change frequently.
# Use a tuple when you have a collection of items that are ordered and do not change.
# Use a set when you have a collection of items that are unordered and do not have duplicates.
# Use a dictionary when you have a collection of items that are unordered, change frequently, and indexed.
