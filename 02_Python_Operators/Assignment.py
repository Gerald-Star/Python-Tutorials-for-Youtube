    This function demonstrates different types of assignment operators in Python.

    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can be used to perform various operations
    such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc., while assigning the result to a variable.

    """

    x += y

    # Subtraction assignment operator
    x -= y

    # Multiplication assignment operator

  This is a function that demonstrates different assignment operator types in Python.

  Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform additional operations
  such as arithmetic or bitwise operations.
"""
  Here are some examples of assignment operator types:
  
  # = : Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
  x = 10
  print(x)  # Output: 10
  
  # += : Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left.
  x += 5
  print(x)  # Output: 15 (10 + 5 = 15)
  
  # -= : Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left.
  x -= 3
  print(x)  # Output: 12 (15 - 3 = 12)
  
  # *= : Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left.
  x *= 2
  print(x)  # Output: 24 (12 * 2 = 24)
  
  # /= : Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right.
  x /= 4
  print(x)  # Output: 6.0 (24 / 4 = 6.0)
  
  # %= : Computes the modulus of the variable on the left with the value on the right.
  x %= 2
  print(x)  # Output: 0.0 (6.0 % 2 = 0.0)
  
  //= : Performs floor division of the variable on the left by the value on the right.
  # **= : Raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right.
  x **= 3
  print(x)  # Output: 0.0 (0.0 ** 3 = 0.0)
  
  # <<= : Performs a bitwise left shift of the variable on the left by the value on the right.
  x = 10
  x <<= 2
  print(x)  # Output: 40 (10 << 2 = 40)
  
  # >>= : Performs a bitwise right shift of the variable on the left by the value on the right.
  x >>= 3
  print(x)  # Output: 5 (40 >> 3 = 5)
  
  # &= : Performs a bitwise AND operation between the variable on the left and the value on the right.
  x &= 3
  print(x)  # Output: 1 (5 & 3 = 1)
  
  # |= : Performs a bitwise OR operation between the variable on the left and the value on the right.
  x |= 2
  print(x)  # Output: 3 (1 | 2 = 3)
  
  # ^= : Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable on the left and the value on the right.
  x ^= 1
  print(x)  # Output: 2 (3 ^ 1 = 2)
