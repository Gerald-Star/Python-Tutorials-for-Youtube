# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

# The def keyword is used to define a function in Python

# A function can return data as a result.

# USE CASES FOR FUNCTIONS

# Use a function when you have a block of code that you want to reuse.
# Use a function when you want to pass data into a block of code.
# Use a function when you want to return data from a block of code.
# Use a function when you want to organize your code into smaller blocks.
# Use a function when you want to make your code more readable.
# Use a function when you want to make your code more maintainable.

# Syntax
# def function_name(parameters):
#     # code block
#     # code block
#     # code block
#     return value


# The function_name is the name of the function.
# The parameters are the values passed into the function.
# The code block inside the function is executed when the function is called.
# The return keyword is used to return a value from the function.
# The value is the data returned from the function.


# Arguments


# You can pass a list as an argument into a function.
# You can pass a dictionary as an argument into a function.
# You can pass a tuple as an argument into a function.
# You can pass a set as an argument into a function.

# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
# You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
# The arguments are passed into the function when the function is called.
# You can use the arguments as variables inside the function.

# Syntax
# def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
#     # code block
#     # code block
#     # code block
#     return value


# The parameter1 and parameter2 are the arguments passed into the function.
# The arguments are used as variables inside the function.
# The arguments are specified inside the parentheses after the function name.


#? Difference between a function definition and a function call
# A function definition is a block of code that defines what the function does.
# A function call is when you execute the code block inside the function.

# A function definition is created using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
# A function call is made by using the function name followed by parentheses.


#? Function Parameters
# Parameters are variables that are used to pass values into a function.
# Parameters are specified inside the parentheses after the function name.
# You can pass multiple parameters into a function by separating them with commas.
# You can pass a list as a parameter into a function.


#? Function Arguments
# Arguments are the values that are passed into a function when it is called.
# Arguments are specified inside the parentheses when calling a function.
# You can pass multiple arguments into a function by separating them with commas.
# You can pass a list as an argument into a function.



#? Different ways to call a function

# You can call a function by using the function name followed by parentheses.
# You can call a function multiple times.
# You can call a function inside another function.
# You can call a function inside a loop.
# You can call a function inside a conditional statement.


# You can pass arguments into a function by specifying the parameter inside the parentheses.
# You can pass multiple arguments into a function by separating them with commas.
# You can pass a list as an argument into a function.
