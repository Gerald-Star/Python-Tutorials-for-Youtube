# Python Sets
# Python Set is an unordered collection of unique items.
# Set is defined by values separated by a comma inside braces { }.
# Items in a set are not ordered.
# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.
# Set is mutable, i.e., we can change the items after the set is created.
# We can add or remove items from the set.
# Sets are used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.

#? SET USE CASES
# Use a set when you want to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Use a set when you want to ensure that the collection of items is unique.
# Use a set when you want to perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, etc.
# Use a set when you want to remove duplicates from a list.
# Use a set when you want to use a collection of items in a dictionary.
# Use a set when you want to use a collection of items in a list.

#* Example 1: Create a set
# A set is a collection of items that are unordered and unindexed.
# Sets are written with curly brackets.
# Set items are unordered, meaning that the items have no defined order.
